# Lessons Learned
<p>This project taught me a lot about accessing information from a database as well as creating a database. I was able to use JPQL queries to make this work. The mapping of this project went much smoother than last weeks project. As far as the front end goes, I could use some more practice and precision beautifying things, but overall I make it look nice. Last week's project definitely helped prepare for this project. </p>
